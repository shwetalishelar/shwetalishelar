I am a passionate professional in Business Intelligence and Business Analysis, with a strong focus on extracting valuable insights from complex datasets and supporting organizations in making informed, data-driven decisions. My enthusiasm extends to designing interactive dashboards that enhance data visualization and empower businesses to make strategic choices.

Currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics, I bring a robust background in business analysis, project management, and data analytics. I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and various project management tools. My expertise lies in leveraging data to drive strategic decision-making, optimize business processes, and manage projects effectively to ensure timely and successful delivery.

Holding a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, my experience includes leading data-driven strategies that have significantly improved operational efficiency. I excel in problem-solving, technical analysis, and auto delivery processes. My strong documentation, collaboration, communication skills, and facilitation abilities enable me to work effectively as a business analyst. I am eager to apply my skills in both business analytics and project management to contribute to innovative projects that drive organizational success.
