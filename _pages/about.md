I’m a passionate professional in Business Analytics and Project Management, focused on turning complex data into actionable insights. I love creating interactive dashboards that help teams visualize data and make smarter, strategic decisions.

Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics while leveraging my experience in business analysis, project management, and data analytics. I’m skilled in Python, R, SQL, and Tableau, and I enjoy using these tools to streamline processes and ensure projects are delivered on time.

With a background in Civil Engineering, I’ve led initiatives that boosted operational efficiency. I thrive on problem-solving and collaboration, and I’m excited to apply my skills to projects that drive real impact.
